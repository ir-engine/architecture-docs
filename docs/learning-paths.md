# iR Engine learning paths

This guide provides recommended learning paths for developers at different experience levels. Choose the path that best matches your current knowledge and goals.

## <a name="beginners"></a>For beginners

If you're new to the iR Engine, follow this path to build a solid foundation:

### 1. Entity component system and Hyperflux

Start with the [Entity component system](./02-entity-component-system/index.md) and [Core engine](./01-core-engine/index.md) (Chapter 1) to understand the foundational architecture of iR Engine. This will introduce you to:

- How entities represent objects in the world
- How components store data and properties
- How systems implement behavior and logic
- How Hyperflux manages state throughout the engine

These two technologies form the cornerstone of understanding how iR Engine works.

### 2. Core engine systems

Continue with the other chapters of [Core engine](./01-core-engine/index.md) to learn about the central systems that power the platform:

- Scene management and rendering
- Asset loading and management
- Avatar systems
- Interaction framework
- Visual scripting integration

### 3. Client and server architecture

Explore the [Client core](./04-client-core/index.md) and [Server core](./05-server-core/index.md) to understand the client-server architecture:

- Client-side rendering and UI
- Server-side logic and persistence
- How client and server communicate
- Authentication and authorization

### 4. Networking

Finally, dive into [Networking](./03-networking/index.md) to see how everything communicates:

- Network architecture
- Data synchronization
- Real-time communication
- WebRTC integration

## <a name="intermediate"></a>For intermediate developers

After understanding the core components, explore these specialized topics:

### 1. Physics and spatial systems

The [Physics and spatial systems](./06-physics-and-spatial-systems/index.md) documentation will help you understand:

- 3D world simulation
- Physics engine integration
- Collision detection
- Spatial queries and relationships

### 2. Input and interaction

The [Input and interaction](./07-input-and-interaction/index.md) documentation covers:

- Input handling across devices
- Interaction systems
- XR controller support
- Pointer and gesture recognition

### 3. UI framework

The [UI framework](./08-ui-framework/index.md) documentation explains:

- UI component architecture
- 2D and 3D user interfaces
- XRUI system for immersive interfaces
- Theming and styling

## <a name="advanced"></a>For advanced developers

For those interested in extending the engine or understanding its deeper systems:

### 1. Multiplayer infrastructure

The [Multiplayer infrastructure](./11-multiplayer-infrastructure/index.md) documentation covers:

- Instanceserver architecture
- WebRTC networking
- Agones integration
- Voice and video communication

### 2. Matchmaking system

The [Matchmaking system](./12-matchmaking-system/index.md) documentation explains:

- Open Match integration
- Matchmaking algorithms
- Player grouping and session creation
- Match assignment

### 3. Visual scripting

The [Visual scripting](./09-visual-scripting/index.md) documentation details:

- Node-based programming system
- Visual script execution
- Custom node creation
- Integration with other systems

### 4. Background processing

The [Background processing](./13-background-processing/index.md) documentation covers:

- Asynchronous task handling
- Task scheduling
- Analytics and event processing
- Service integration

### 5. World editor

The [World editor](./10-world-editor/index.md) documentation explains:

- 3D world creation tools
- Asset management
- Scene editing
- Entity manipulation
- Visual scripting integration

## Custom learning paths

Depending on your role and goals, you might want to create a custom learning path:

### For game developers

1. Start with the Entity component system
2. Move to Physics and spatial systems
3. Explore Input and interaction
4. Learn about Visual scripting

### For backend developers

1. Begin with Server core
2. Dive into Networking
3. Explore Multiplayer infrastructure
4. Learn about Background processing

### For frontend developers

1. Start with Client core
2. Move to UI framework
3. Explore Input and interaction
4. Learn about Visual scripting
